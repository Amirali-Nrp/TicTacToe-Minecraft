i just can say i enjoyed working on it and my experience was wonderful
except the part i didnt know what to do
and it was interesting exploring its classes
and making a plugin for minecraft-a game im in love with- was the dream
not gonna lie it was hard because of having no experience but in the end i enjoyed it
i spent about 15 hours on it, it was hard debugging it but here we are
