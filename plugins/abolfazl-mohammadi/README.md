I just can say I enjoyed working on it and my experience was wonderful. Except for the part that I didn't know what to do and it was interesting exploring spigot's classes and making a plugin for Minecraft -the game I'm in love with- was the dream. I'm not gonna lie ,it was hard because of having no experience, but at the end, I enjoyed it.

>I spent about 15 hours on it, it was hard to debug it but here we are 7/5/2022.
